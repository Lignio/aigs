In lab 3 I have learned how an implementation of Map-Elite can look like. This includes the thought process which needs to go into deciding on a fitness function, along with behavioral axes of the environment. Additionally, I have learned how evolutionary algorithms overall work -> generate population, select most fit, mutate/crossover -> repeat (without the first step). 
The lab has made me spend some time thinking about possible applications for these types of algorithms, especially possible applications for pcg related to games. I find specially the design of more advanced fitness functions and the idea of using more two dimensional behavioral grid to be interesting.  For “updating” the population I have also learned a bit about figuring out whether mutating or crossover (or both) makes the most sense for the given environment. Specifically, I think mutating tends to be a bit easier way to create meaningful variation, but comes at the cost of the variation being random, and therefore not necessarily useful. Crossover on the other hand can be more efficient but one has to think about whether the crossover should be random or only pseudo random (eg. Which rules should be applied for any given crossover).
